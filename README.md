Create a case database for Low-income Taxpayer clinic (LITC). The LITC cases can take up to months, such as some of the court cases, while some can be done in the same day. And some of the cases are event with multiple issues that need to be reopen at some point. Therefore, we have a hard time to keep track the clients and have hard time when we do reports.
